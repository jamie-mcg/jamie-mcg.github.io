So, functions which change too fast and/or become infinitely steep are not Lipschitz functions.</p> <p>More formally, let $\chi \in R^{d}$ be a d-dimensional subspace of real values. If we take a function $f: R^{d} \rightarrow R^{n}$ which provides a mapping from a d-dimensional space to a p-dimensional space, we can say that $f$ is $L$-Lipschitz over $\chi$ if and only if we have:</p> \[|f(x_{2}) - f(x_{1})| \le L | x_{1} - x_{2} | \forall x_{1}, x_{2} \in \chi\] <p>I always think this looks a bit confusing written this way, so a more intuitive way to write it is simply:</p> \[\frac{|f(x_{2}) - f(x_{1})|}{ | x_{1} - x_{2} | } \le L \forall x_{1}, x_{2} \in \chi\] <p>where we now have the form of $\Delta y / \Delta x$ on the left hand side.</p> <p>Thinking about this a bit more, this condition demands that the slope of the secant line between two points $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ must be between $-L \le m \le L$.</p> <h3 id="example-is-cosine-lipschitz">Example: Is cosine Lipschitz?</h3> <p>Start by employing the definition above,</p> \[\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} \simeq f^{'}(x) = \text{sin}(x)\] <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>We know that $</td> <td>\text{sin}(x)</td> <td>\le 1$, so we can rewrite this as:</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> \[|f(x) - f(y)| \le L | x - y |\] <p>where L = 1. So we say that cosine is a 1-Lipschitz function.</p> <h2 id="globally--locally-lipschitz">Globally &amp; Locally Lipschitz</h2> <p>Just to round off this small post, I want to talk a bit about global and local Lipschitz functions. The above section kind of describes functions which are globally Lipschitz since we haven’t defined a subset of the function space to consider, so here, we’ll start local!</p> <p>Say for example, we have some function $f$ which is locally Lipschitz for a compact subset of $\chi$. We’ll call this $\Omega \subset \chi \in R^{d}$.</p> <p>For the local Lipschitz property to hold, it must be true that there is a constant $L_{\Omega}$ such that,</p> \[|f(x) - f(y)| \le L_{\Omega} | x - y |, \forall x_{1}, x_{2} \in \Omega\] <p>where $L_{\Omega}$ can indeed depend on the subset $\Omega$. For example, the function $f(x) = x^{2}$ has an $L_{\Omega}$ which depends on $x$ (since only one of the $x^{2}$ will cancel). Therefore as the subset $\Omega$ becomes larger, $L_{\Omega}$ will scale linearly with this.</p> <p>The above example defines a situation where we have local Lipschitzness but not global!</p> <p>For global Lipschitzness, we require the function to have a Lipschitz constant which does not depend on the subset $\Omega$, i.e. $L_{\Omega} = L$.</p> <p>I hope this post has been a useful primer into the property of Lipschitzness.
