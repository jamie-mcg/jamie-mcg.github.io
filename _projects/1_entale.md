As part of a two week Data Study Group event, I worked as part of a multidisciplinary team to develop a Podcast Recommendation System for a startup company named <a href="https://www.entale.co/">Entale</a>. We managed to achieve `Rabbit Hole' style recommendations using NLP techniques and topic modelling which gives the user a unique listening experience. This work is currently ongoing and in the process of being submitted for publication.
