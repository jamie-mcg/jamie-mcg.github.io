I was involved in a collaborative team of Ph.D students from UCL who were tasked with maximising the potential of the camera systems used at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy through image processing and stabilisation techniques. Our results showed promising solutions which helped alleviate some of the main issues of maintaining a fixed coordinate system and was part of an initial effort to automate the stabilisation of visual data used to analyse the plasma inside the nuclear fusion reactor.
