I am a Research Scientist at MediaTek Research. My research is focussed on the training dynamics of neural networks and the interpretibility of their predictions. My (vague and ambitious) research aim is to develop a deeper knowledge of how and why deep neural networks learn in specific ways and use this understanding to inform the next generation of AI.

Some very broad questions I have been thinking about recently include:

- How can neural networks become plastic?
  - This is related to brain plasticity and recent efforts in structural learning.
- How can task dependent behaviours be extracted in deep networks?
  - Follow up question: How can they be inserted?
- What is next after Adam?
  - Or are we going to be using it forever and ever...

My background and training is in Theoretical Physics where I worked on extending our understanding of the Standard Model in a data-driven environment.
